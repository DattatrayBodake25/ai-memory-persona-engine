Gupshupp AI Memory & Persona Engine System

This project is a full-stack AI-powered system that demonstrates long-term memory extraction from conversational messages and dynamic persona-based response generation. It integrates a structured backend service built with FastAPI and a modern interactive frontend built with React and TailwindCSS. The system is designed to process user messages, infer long-term behavioral and factual patterns, and respond in different conversational styles while maintaining consistency with extracted memory.

The application includes a memory extraction pipeline, a persona transformation engine, and a polished UI for interaction — allowing users to send a message, view both neutral and persona-styled responses side-by-side, and visualize extracted memories in collapsible sections.

🧠 Backend Architecture
Memory Extraction Module

Processes up to 30 conversational messages

Uses OpenAI (gpt-mini-4o) with strict JSON schema enforcement

Extracts:

Preferences

Emotional patterns

Factual memories

Results are stored in SQLite for retrieval and persistent personalization.

Personality Engine

Generates a neutral response based on the user’s message

Rewrites the response into a chosen persona style

Maintains clarity and consistency across tone transformations

OpenAI Wrapper

A unified client ensures all requests:

Use the selected model

Support optional JSON-mode generation

Return clean text outputs

🚀 Project Overview (Descriptive Summary)

This system demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building memory-aware AI conversation tools. The backend uses structured prompt engineering and schema-based extraction to identify long-term user traits from chat history, such as preferences, emotional tendencies, and factual details. These memories are stored persistently and can influence future interactions.

On top of this, the application integrates a persona engine capable of rewriting responses into various conversational tones while preserving meaning. The frontend provides a clean, intuitive interface that displays extracted memory, enables persona selection, and shows both neutral and styled AI responses side-by-side for comparison. Together, these components create a highly interactive and extensible AI companion experience, suitable for personalization use cases, behavioral modeling, and conversational agents.
